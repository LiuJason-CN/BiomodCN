<h2>Methods</h2>
<h2>Preparation of right-handed DNA duplex and left-handed one<h2>
<h3>1.	Preparation of ssDNA circle:<h3/>
<h4>1)	Phosphorylation of single strand DNA in 5’ end.</h4>
<p>All DNA strands were synthesized and purified by Life technologies（改公司名称）. We need 5μl of original material（single strand DNA）to make  the final concentration be 5μmol/L, 2μl of ATP to provide phosphate group, 2μl of PNK ligase to promote phosphorylation, 2μl of PNK buffer A to provide other ion conditions, and 10μl of ddH2O to add the volume to 20μl. Mix the above reagents in a tube, heat the mixture in PCR Thermocycle Instrument to 37℃ and incubate for a whole night, then heat up to 75℃ for 10 minutes to inactivate the ligase.</p>
<h4>2)	Circularization of single strand DNA by using splint.</h4>
<p>We need 2μl of single strand DNA solution after phosphorylation from the step 1 to make the final concentration be 0.5μmol/L, 2μl splint to promote the circularization of single strand DNA, 2μl T4 DNA ligase buffer, 0.5μl T4 DNA ligase, and 13.5μl ddH2O to add the volume to 20μl. Mix the above reagents and heat the mixture to 90℃ for 3 minutes to open the secondary structure, then incubate in 25℃ for 3 hours, finally, heat up to 65℃ for 10 minutes to inactivate the ligase.
</p>
<h4>3)	ExonucleaseⅠto cleave non-circular single strand DNA.</h4>
<p>Keep the proportion of sample, exonucleaseⅠand exonucleaseⅠin 9:1:0.5. Mix the above reagents in a tube, then put them in PCR Thermocycle Instrument, react in 37℃ for 2 hours, then react in 75℃ for 15 minutes to inactivate the exonucleaseⅠ.</p>
<h4>4)	Phenol chloroform extraction and alcohol precipitation.</h4>
<p>Phenol chloroform extraction is to wipe off protein, polysaccharide and phenolic substance and alcohol precipitation is to dissociate the nucleic acid from the system.</p>
<h3>2.	Preparation of Z-B DNA chimera:</h3>
<h4>1)	Base pairing reaction between two circular DNAs with complementary sequences.</h4>
<p>Mix the products from the step 1 4)（circle A and its complementary circle B）up in another tube and keep their proportion in 1:1, add 10×NEB1.1 buffer and ddH2O to the tube, react in 90℃ for 3 minutes to open the secondary structure, then ramp down to 25℃by 0.1℃/s and react for 10 minutes.</p>
<h4>2)	Preparation of reference samples.</h4>
<h5>(1)	Base pairing reaction between circular DNA and its complementary ssDNA.</h5>
<p>Mix up the circular DNAs and its complementary ssDNA and keep their proportion in 1:1, add 10×NEB1.1 buffer and ddH2O to the tube, react in 90℃ for 3 minutes to open the secondary structure, then ramp down to 25℃by 0.1℃/s and react for 10 minutes.</p>
<h5>(2)	Base pairing reaction between complementary linear DNAs.</h5>
<p>Mix linear A and it’s complementary linear B in 1×NEB1.1 reaction buffer and keep their proportion in 1:1, add ddH2O to the tube, heat up to 90℃ for 3 minutes to open the secondary structure, then cool down to 25℃( 0.1℃/s) and keep for 10 minutes.</p>
<h5>(3)	Reaction between ss-cirDNA and it’s complementary linear DNA withT4 DNA ligase.</h5>
<p>Mix circle DNA and it’s complementary linear DNA in 1×T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer ( 4.5μl ) and keep their proportion in 1:1, add 0.5μl T4 DNA ligase and ddH2O to the tube, heat up to 80℃ for 3 minutes to open the secondary structure, then cool down to 25℃( 0.1℃/s )and keep for 2 hours, inactivate enzyme by heating the mixture up to 65℃for 10 minutes. Then the closed B-DNA circles were prepared.</p>
<h3>3.	Gel electrophoresis:</h3>
<p>Z-B DNA chimera was analyzed on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel with 10mM MgCl2 under 250V and an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel under 350V respectively. The native polyacrylamide gels were run in 1X TBE buffer with 1mM MgCl2 at the temperature under 20℃ and the denaturing polyacrylamide were run in 1×TBE at ambient temperature. ( The preparation of 8% native polyacrylamide gel and the condition of running buffer were optimized, the reason why we optimized the experiment condition will debate in Discussion 1(此处应有超链接). ) Samples were prepared as below: </p>

<h3>4.	AFM</h3>
<p> (AFM) measurements were performed at room temperature using a multimode scanning probe microscope with a Nanoscope 3A controller (Digital Instruments/Veeco Probes/USA). AFM images were recorded on freshly cleaved mica surfaces, prepared by the deposition of a 10 μL sample of the respective DNA nanostructures. The simples were dried in the air. Images were taken with MPP-11100-70 tips (Veeco) using the tapping mode at their resonant frequency.</p>
